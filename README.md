## Project Overview

The Spy Cat Agency Management Application provides the following features:

- **Spy Cats**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete spy cats.
- **Missions**: Create missions with targets, assign cats to missions, and manage mission completion.
- **Targets**: Update target notes and mark targets as complete.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spy-cat-agency.git
   cd spy-cat-agency
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

## Running the Application

Start the development server with the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Postman Collection

To simplify API testing, you can import the following Postman collection:

1. **Copy the JSON below and save it as `SCA_Postman_Collection.json`**:

   ```json
   {
     "info": {
       "name": "Spy Cat Agency API",
       "_postman_id": "your-postman-id",
       "description": "Postman collection for Spy Cat Agency API",
       "schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.1.0/collection.json"
     },
     "item": [
       {
         "name": "List Spy Cats",
         "request": {
           "method": "GET",
           "header": [],
           "url": {
             "raw": "http://localhost:8000/spycats/",
             "protocol": "http",
             "host": ["localhost"],
             "port": "8000",
             "path": ["spycats", ""]
           }
         },
         "response": []
       },
       {
         "name": "Create Spy Cat",
         "request": {
           "method": "POST",
           "header": [
             {
               "key": "Content-Type",
               "value": "application/json"
             }
           ],
           "body": {
             "mode": "raw",
             "raw": "{\n  "name": "Whiskers",\n  "years_of_experience": 5,\n  "breed": "Siamese",\n  "salary": 50000.00\n}"
           },
           "url": {
             "raw": "http://localhost:8000/spycats/",
             "protocol": "http",
             "host": ["localhost"],
             "port": "8000",
             "path": ["spycats", ""]
           }
         },
         "response": []
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Import the Collection into Postman**:

   - Open Postman.
   - Click on `Import` in the top-left corner.
   - Select `File` and choose the `SCA_Postman_Collection.json` file you saved.
   - The collection will be imported and available for use.

**Note**: Adjust the host and port in the collection if your application is running on a different address.

## Notes

- **Breed Validation**: The application validates cat breeds using [TheCatAPI](https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds). Ensure you have an active internet connection when creating or updating spy cats.

- **Error Handling**: The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for invalid requests. For example, attempting to delete a mission assigned to a cat will return a `400 Bad Request` with an error message.

- **Data Formats**: All request and response bodies are in JSON format.

- **Authentication**: This application does not include authentication mechanisms. For production use, consider adding authentication and permissions.

- **Testing**: Automated tests are included in the `tests` file. Run them with:

  ```bash
  python manage.py test
  ```

- **Admin Interface**: Access the Django admin interface at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` using the superuser account you created earlier.
